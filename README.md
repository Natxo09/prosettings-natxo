# Natxo - CS2 Settings

My personal Counter-Strike 2 settings and gaming setup showcase website.

## What is this?

This is a single-page web application where I display my CS2 configurations, gaming peripherals, and statistics. It's built to share my settings with the community and keep everything organized in one place.

### Features

- **CS2 Settings**: Crosshair, viewmodel, launch options, video settings, HUD, and radar configurations
- **Gaming Setup**: Detailed specs of my mouse, monitor, keyboard, headphones, microphone, mousepad, and PC
- **Live Stats**: Real-time CS2 Premier rating from Leetify API and FACEIT ELO
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme switching with smooth transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### Tech Stack

Built with:
- **Next.js 16** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Styling
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **Leetify API** - CS2 Premier statistics
- **FACEIT API** - FACEIT ELO data

### Live Stats

The page automatically fetches and displays:
- CS2 Premier rating (refreshed every hour)
- FACEIT ELO (refreshed every hour)

Data is cached server-side to optimize API usage.

### Open Source

This project is open source as a reference for others building similar showcase sites. Feel free to check out the code and use it as inspiration for your own projects.
